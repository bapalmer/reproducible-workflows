# Load the tidyverse
library(tidyverse)

# 1. Let's examine the main differences between a data frame and a tibble
# Let's download a data set that we'll take with us through the day
url <- "http://varianceexplained.org/files/Brauer2008_DataSet1.tds"

example_tbl <- read_delim(url, delim = "\t")

# It has been imported as a tibble

# 2. Convert this tibble to a data.frame you might be more familiar with
example_df <- as.data.frame(example_tbl)

# 3. View it in the console by running the following code and note
# any differences between the outputs
example_df

# Tibbles are designed not to overwhelm your console when you print 
# large data frames
# It will print only the first 10 row and the number of columns that
# will fit on your screen
example_tbl
# Also, each column will report its type

# 4. If you want to change this, you can request it explicitly
example_tbl %>%
  print(n = 20, width = Inf) # Inf will print all the columns

# 5. You might find functions from other packages won't work with tibbles
# This is often due to the subsetting operations using "[" function
class(example_tbl[1,1])
class(example_df[1,1])

# So with tibbles, [ always returns another tibble

# If you get into trouble, you can convert the tibble to a data frame
example_tbl_now_a_df <- as.data.frame(example_tbl)

# 6. What's the difference between these two objects?
str(tibble(
  x = 1:5, 
  y = letters[1:5]
))

str(data.frame(
  x = 1:5, 
  y = letters[1:5]
))

# A tibble won't change the input
# Here, data.frame() converted a string to a factor

# 7. Tidy up the Global Environment
rm(url, example_df, example_tbl, example_tbl_now_a_df)
